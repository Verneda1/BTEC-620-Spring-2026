#Install Affymetrix library/Package 
if (!require("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE))
+     install.packages("BiocManager")

BiocManager::install("affy")

#Load the library Affy
library(affy)

#Set the working directory to a floder where you have .CEL files
setwd("/Users/verneda/Desktop")

#Read the 4 .CEL files in R
data <- ReadAffy()

#Generate a box to visable dataset 
boxplot(data)

# Normalize the dataset to remove ant outliers and stable the median for all .CEL files 
normalizeddata <-rma(data)

#Generate a boxplot to vissualize normalized dataset 
boxplot(exprs(normalizeddata))

#Fold change analysis for comparing treatment vs control samples

#Lets assume GSM4843.CEL and GSM4844.CEL samples to be Leukemia/Blood cancer and GSM4845.CEL and GSM4846.CEL to be normal blood samples

#Take means/average on each row
Newdata <-exprs(normalizeddata)
Treatment <-Newdata[,c(1,2)]
Control <-Newdata[,c(3,4)]

#Apply the rowmeans function to calculate averages
Treatmentaverage <-rowMeans(Treatment)
Controlaverage <-rowMeans(Control)

#Apply fold change by subtraction 
foldchange <-Treatmentaverage - Controlaverage

#If genes fold change value if >2 its an up-regulated gene, and if its <-2 its a down-regulated gene, and if genes are between -2 and +2 they are insignificant genes 

#Export variable foldchange in an CSV file 
write.csv(foldchange,"foldchange.csv")
